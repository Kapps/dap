/// A stream is responsible only for managing the actual reading and writing of the buffered data.
/// For modifying the data as it's written, a Stream may have zero or more DataTransformers.
/// These transformers may be chained together in a priority queue, allowing for more complex transforms.
/// Details:
///		When a Write is requested, it gets added to an internal buffer.
/// 	Then, when a Read or Seek is requested, PerformWrite is called causing the transformed buffer to be written (but not flushed).
/// 	Most implementations will likely flush the buffer anyways however.
///		When a Read is requested, BufferSize bytes are requested to be read from the derived Stream.
///		If the Stream is only capable of Reading, and not Writing, the entire buffer is transformed at this point.
/// 	Otherwise, it's not safe to transform the buffer because we can't put back bytes nor untransform, and it is necessary to if a Write is requested, as it may overwrite.
/// 	If this is the case, we transform per-read. Which is inefficient, but much easier than the alternative implementation (which may be put in later, but probably not).
/// 	Another issue is the user may pass in a buffer not large enough to contain the transformed data. Then we get to buffering in another buffer and complications.
/// 	For now, solve that by just completely not supporting reads and writes combined.
/// Bugs:
///		ReadWrite Mode is not yet supported. Only Read or Write.
