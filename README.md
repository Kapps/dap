DAP - D Asset Pipeline is a content pipeline vaguely based off of Microsoft's XNA Framework, used to convert assets into a format more easily read at runtime. DAP is capable of parallel builds, custom processors, compression and archiving, and is independent of IO systems (however only file storage is implemented at the moment).

DAP is a work in progress and far from ready for public use.
