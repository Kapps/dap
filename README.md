DAP - D Asset Pipeline is a content pipeline vaguely based off of Microsoft's XNA Framework, used to convert assets into a format more easily read at runtime. DAP is capable of parallel builds, custom processors, compression and archiving, and is independent of IO systems (however only file storage is implemented at the moment).

DAP is a work in progress and not quite ready for public use. Current development focus is on implementing packed archives, better compression algorithms, and most importantly, implementing more providers. Some features, such as loading dynamic libraries containing importers and processors, will have to wait until better shared library support exists in D.
